# uRequire v0.7.0-beta.33

## Beta release note

[_Docs / wiki](http://anodynos.github.io/uRequire) mainly are **Work In Progress** (in transition from v0.6.x) - but everything should work except you'll need `npm install urequire-cli -g` & `npm install urequire` locally (if you are using the CLI urequire instead of the the recommended [grunt-urequire](https://github.com/aearly/grunt-urequire)). Check **uRequire's [master config / docs](https://github.com/anodynos/uRequire/blob/master/source/code/config/MasterDefaultsConfig.coffee.md)** for up to date usage._

## The JavaScript Universal Module & Resource Converter (and automagical builder, test runner and more)...

All documentation is at [uRequire GitHub Pages](http://anodynos.github.io/uRequire)

## What's uRequire ?

For a quick taste of how much uRequire rocks, with minimal grunting or gulping, check [urequire-example-helloworld](https://github.com/anodynos/urequire-example-helloworld). With just ~30 lines of DRY & declarative uRequire config, this example shows off the automagical :

* transparent compilation from **coffee-script**, **coco**, **LiveScript** etc to **javascript**. They are all javascript, right ?

* conversion from **AMD** or **CommonJs** (or a combination of both) to **UMD** or **combined** (`<script>`, `AMD` & `nodejs` compatible) javascript.

* importing of dependencies (i.e `dependencies: imports: lodash: ['_']`) *and* keys out of them (`resources: ['import-keys', {'chai': 'expect'} ] ]`) to all modules in the bundle (held by some variable name). The latter uses the `urequire-rc-import-keys` ResourceConverter *plugin*.

* injection of a `var VERSION = 'x.x.x';` in *main module's body*, where `'x.x.x'` comes from `package.json` (using the `urequire-rc-inject-version` ResourceConverter *plugin*).

* gereration of a standard *banner*, with info from `package.json`.

* declarative exporting of main module on `window.myModule` (with `noConflict()` baked in).

* minification with **uglify2's** passing some rudimentary options.

* discovery of dependencies's paths using the info already in **bower** or nodejs's **npm**.

* generated tests that run on nodejs & **phantomjs** (browser) via **mocha** (& **chai**), both as **Web/AMD** & **Web/Script**. It even generates the required HTML, with all module's paths, **requirejs**'s configs & shims or `<script ...>` tags etc.

* watch facility with rapid rebuilds, since it compiles *only files that have really changed* and also runs the tests only if a) there were changes and b) with no compilation errors.

* clean of destination files / folders before each build.

* deriving (i.e like *inheritance* in OO) of configs.

* passing r.js options

* a cross *module systems development*, *cross runtimes deployment* & automagical continuous testing.

* and *last but not least*: The *elimination* of (the need for) **grunt plugins**. There's isnt any hint of `grunt-xxx` for `watch`, `coffee-script`, `browserify`, `uglify`, `mocha`, `concat`, `phantomjs`, `banner`, `clean` etc). This is great news cause cause **grunt plugins have many disadvantages** :

     * repeating the same source & dest paths & files all over again (when you should keep it DRY)

     * you have to learn the intricacies & syntax of each plugin

     * making sure they run in the right order & hope they produce the right result

     * producing many intermediate temp files

     * building everything with each change etc

     * writing stuff for things that should be automagical ;-)

Who's gulping ?
